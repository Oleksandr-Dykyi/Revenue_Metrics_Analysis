## Revenue Metrics Analysis

#### Technology Stack:
PostgreSQL (CTE, joins, data aggregation, window functions), Tableau (calculated fields, quick table calculations, dashboard creation)

#### Project Description:
In this project, I developed a comprehensive dashboard to analyze cash flows, enabling product managers to monitor changes in cash inflows and conduct analyses of influencing factors.

The dashboard encompasses key metrics:
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): Revenue for a calendar month from repeating sources.
Paid Users: Number of paying users.
Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU): Calculated as Revenue / Paid Users.
New Paid Users: Users who initiated payments in the corresponding period.
New MRR: MRR generated by paid users in the relevant month.
Churned Users: Users who ceased payments in the corresponding period.
Churn Rate: Ratio of Churned Users to Paid Users in the previous period.
Churned Revenue: Total revenue from users who stopped paying in the previous period.
Revenue Churn Rate: Ratio of revenue from users who didn't continue paying in the previous month to revenue for a specific calendar month.
Expansion MRR: Increase in MRR from one month to another by users paying more.
Contraction MRR: Decrease in MRR from one month to the next by users paying less.
Customer Lifetime (LT): Average time from first payment to user churn.
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Average total amount paid by one user over their product usage.
The dashboard features seven charts with filters by date, user language, and age. Two charts display factors influencing revenue and paid users monthly.

Presented the project from the user's perspective, illustrating how to effectively utilize the dashboard during a visual presentation.
